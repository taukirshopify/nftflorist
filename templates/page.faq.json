            "faq-content": "<p>• NFT (Non-Fungible Token) is a unique digital asset that is verified on a blockchain, a decentralized digital ledger that records transactions.  NFTs are one-of-a-kind and cannot be exchanged for other NFTs at a fixed value, hence the term \"non-fungible.\" Each NFT contains a digital signature that proves its authenticity, ownership, and scarcity. NFTs are often used to represent digital art, music, videos, and other forms of creative content, and can be bought, sold, and traded on digital marketplaces. The NFT market in 2022 was worth over $22 billion.<br\/>•\tThe industry has dramatically grown since 2020. NFTs are extremely popular!<br\/>•\tNFT sales hit $25 billion in 2021.<br\/>•\tThe NFT Market is projected to be worth $80 billion by 2025.<br\/>•\tThe most expensive collection of NFTs was sold at $91.8 million.<br\/>•\tNFT sales amount to approximately $1.8 billion every month. <br\/>•\tHalf of NFT's cost more than $200.<\/p>"

            "faq-title": "How does The NFT Florist fight the extreme cost of fresh cut flowers?",
            "faq-content": "<p>The vast majority of Fresh cut flowers are imported from foreign countries. This involves many expenses, including growing costs such as transportation, delivery, labor, harvest and floral preparation, seeds, water, fertilizers, insecticides, and many other expenses, required for final delivery to customers. Transportation costs are significant, as the flowers are often transported long distances via jets from the growing region to the point of sale, involving fuel, labor, and other shipping expenses. The flowers require constant specialized storage and handling to maintain their quality and freshness, which include refrigeration, packaging, and labor costs. Marketing and distribution costs include advertising, promotions, as well as the cost of distributing the flowers to retail stores or other outlets. Finally, fresh cut flowers have a limited shelf life and must be disposed of properly, leading to expenses associated with waste disposal or composting. The expenses associated with fresh cut flowers are significant and are largely influenced by factors such as the growing region, transportation costs, and market demand.  Overall, The NFT Florist combats the ridiculous high cost of imported fresh cut flowers by offering a cost-efficient beautiful alternative of NFT flowers that cut out all these listed costs and our flowers bloom forever.<\/p>"
