This can be seen in the naming of the bouquets, and the exquisite attention to detail in the NFTs. Rather than harming the planet with expensive and unhealthy pesticides, preservatives, and fertilizers, our flowers are delivered instantly as giftable, digital art to your account and can be traded on the blockchain. We have made the buying, sending, delivery, and transfer process as easy as possible so that anyone can become a patron, even with zero knowledge of NFTs. <\/p><p>We are interested in building a community of passionate creatives to bridge the gap between tangible assets and the world of digital, collectible art. Through this, we strive to offer low-cost, low-risk, high-quality products that last a lifetime.<br\/><\/p>"
