        "richtext": "<p>Hey, I’m Rebecca Katherine Levenson, the Founder of the NFT Florist and ArtRKL. My weekly grocery haul always consists of a bouquet of fresh flowers, but within two days they are wilted and beyond saving. About a year ago, I envisioned having a beautiful flower bouquet, or a few, that would never wilt, and thus the NFT Florist was born. Our products and processes are a fabulous solution for someone who loves fresh flowers. While our bouquets are stunningly realistic, they are not photographs of flowers—instead, they are pieces of original, collectible art created by our team of talented digital artists.<br\/><br\/>At The NFT Florist, Our Flowers Bloom Forever. When you purchase an NFT bouquet, you are immediately established in a community that merges the NFT and digital art communities.<\/p>",
        "text-2": "<p>Beyond that, we are inclusive to all floral species, and honor and respect their natural habitats. This can be seen in the naming of the bouquets, and the exquisite attention to detail in the NFTs. Rather than harming the planet with expensive and unhealthy pesticides, preservatives, and fertilizers, our flowers are delivered instantly as giftable, digital art to your account and can be traded on the blockchain. We have made the buying, sending, delivery, and transfer process as easy as possible so that anyone can become a patron, even with zero knowledge of NFTs. <\/p><p>We are interested in building a community of passionate creatives to bridge the gap between tangible assets and the world of digital, collectible art. Through this, we strive to offer low-cost, low-risk, high-quality products that last a lifetime.<br\/><\/p>"
